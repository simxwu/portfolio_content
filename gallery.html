            This page is a gallery of photos of food from different resturants around the boston area.
            With a rich colonial history, international influences (North End, weâ€™re talking to you), and a seaside locale, Boston certainly has a seat at the big-name dining table. Through the years, the city has morphed its simple local flavor into globally recognized and universally loved classic dishes.

            Ramen: According to a press release, Menya Jiro is now open in Dedham, moving into a space at Legacy Place across the parking lot from Gap and next to Urban Outfitters. The new location of the Japan-based group of restaurants joins another in Cambridge's Harvard Square, and in addition to ramen and other options, the new outlet also features yakitori-style skewered meats, seafood, and veggies that are grilled over hot coals.
